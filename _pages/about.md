Welcome ! I am a French PhD, specialized in Graph Algorithms, with a particular interest in trees, enumeration and compression methods. Apart from that, I am also interested in combinatorics, optimization and machine learning. I'm currently focusing on bioinformatics, and in particular the indexing of RNA sequences.

Since September 2023, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Bonsai team](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/bonsai/), affiliated to the [Cristal laboratory](https://www.cristal.univ-lille.fr/) in Lille. My work is supervised by [Mikaël Salson](https://mikael-salson.univ-lille.fr/) and [Camille Marchet](https://kamimrcht.github.io/webpage/).

I defended my thesis entitled ["On the Similarities of Trees: the interest of Enumeration and Compression Methods"](https://www.theses.fr/2022ENSL0010) in Septembter 2022. My PhD was done under the supervision of [Christophe Godin](https://team.inria.fr/mosaic/welcome/team-members/christophe-godin) and [Romain Azaïs](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/romain.azais/), in [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), [RDP laboratory](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/RDP/), [Inria team Mosaic](https://team.inria.fr/mosaic/).

Feel free to contact me at florian.ingels[at]univ-lille.fr if you are, indeed, a human person. I'm sorry for the bots out there, but your princess is in another castle !
