Welcome ! I am a French PhD, specialized in Graph Algorithms, with a particular interest in Trees, Enumeration and Compression methods. 

I defended my thesis entitled "On the Similarities of Trees: the interest of Enumeration and Compression Methods" early this year, in Septembter 2022. My PhD was done under the supervision of Christophe Godin and Romain Azaïs, in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.
