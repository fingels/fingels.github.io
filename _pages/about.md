Welcome ! I am a French PhD, specialized in Graph Algorithms, with a particular interest in trees, enumeration and compression methods. Apart from that, I am also interested in combinatorics and optimization.

I defended my thesis entitled ["On the Similarities of Trees: the interest of Enumeration and Compression Methods"](https://www.theses.fr/s238309) earlier this year, in Septembter 2022. 

My PhD was done under the supervision of [Christophe Godin](https://team.inria.fr/mosaic/welcome/team-members/christophe-godin) and [Romain Azaïs](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/romain.azais/), in [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), [RDP laboratory](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/RDP/), [Inria team Mosaic](https://team.inria.fr/mosaic/).
